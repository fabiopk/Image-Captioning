# Image-Captioning

Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Project for automatic image captioning.
The dataset used is Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context).
In these notebooks a network is trained to create dewscriptions of what is shown in the image.

For example:

![Sample of the network]('./sample.png')

## Getting Started

This project is fully made using Jupyter Notebooks.
The four main ones are:

-`0_Dataset.ipynb`: Shows the dataset used

-`1_Preliminaries.ipynb`: Checks the dataloader, and how the word embeddings are setup

-`2_Training.ipynb`: Setup the main hyperparameters and trains the network

-`3_Inference.ipynb`: Test the trained network with some examples

I recommend downloading everything and following along with the notebooks in order.
